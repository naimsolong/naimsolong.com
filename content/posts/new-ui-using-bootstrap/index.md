### Fresh UI
After one year journey in XeerSoft, my manager entrust me to design new user interface (UI) for core system’s menu. XeerSoft has serve more than 100 modern businesses as a software solutions provider including Inventory and Accounting modules.

The screenshot below is the original menu UI, it using tree-style UI listing all the pages available in system.

The system’s ages over more than 10 years and it deserve for a make over in order for client feel fresh when using the system. As my tech lead proposed and drafted the design in a piece paper, while I’m convert the idea into reality. As screenshot below is the new menu UI with a little animation for a better user experience:

1. As we hover to title, the title is highlighted using custom CSS 
2. After click the title, the page will appear as right side:

{{< images

{{< images

alt1="Photo UI New 2"
>}}

### Why Use Bootstrap for UI Development?

This is my first ever UI framework that I've learn, Bootstrap provides a lot of benefits for UI development and here are the reasons I consider using Bootstrap:

1. **Responsive design**: Bootstrap is designed to be responsive first, which means that UI will look great on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.
2. **Easy to use**: Bootstrap provides a set of pre-built components that can be use to quickly build UI.
3. **Consistent design**: Bootstrap provides a consistent design language that can use across entire UI. This helps to create a cohesive user experience.

That will be all for today. See you later!
