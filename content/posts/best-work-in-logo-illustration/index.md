Assalamualaikum!

Since study in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) Skudai, various activities/association I have joined such as marathon, pratice silat martial art with [Persatuan Seni Silat Gayung UTM](https://www.facebook.com/pssgutm) and handle [FESKO](https://twitter.com/fesko_utm) event but I can say that I'm quite an introvert person ðŸ˜… not very much into social event, so I spend most of my free time stay at the dorm.

With this I got opportunity to explore on Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator software, just for fun! Most of the tutorials and techniques I have learned from a few Youtube channel (recommended!):

- [Will Paterson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIp9sEZiv36cDG7cEnrVU7Q)
- [tutvide](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeR7U67I2J1icV8E6Rn40vQ)
- [Flux Academy](https://www.youtube.com/@FluxAcademy)

Thus, I would like to share some of the logo design work for inspiration.

### During internship

In my early journey as intern at [RN Technologies](https://rntechnologies.com.my/), I have been given task to design logo for their new initiative which is [MyraHub](http://myrahub.com/).

<!-- i-Cloud allow businesses grow faster on the simple, affordable cloud server. The logo is presenting the name itself, the 'C' shape spiral surround on 'i' with a gap at the bottom with yellow and blue color shade.

However, MyraHub Foundation is a Malaysian non-profit organization (NGO) based in Johor Bahru which actively promotes social developments and support corporate responsibility initiatives to various programs. Thus I wish to make a globe with technological effect but my boss want it to be simple, so I just add the 'Myra Hub' name with it's slogan at the bottom.

### Logo design competition

Other than design logo during my internship, I also take up another challenge in Ekspo Berkemajuan Johor in 2017, where I won a consolation prize of RM500. This event focuses on 12 Johor aspirations which are Johor Prihatin, Johor Selamat, Johor Berbudaya, Johor Islamik and Perumahan Johor.

The logo was inspired by Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque, one of the most famous places of worship in Malaysia because of its status as the state mosque of Johor and its exquisite beauty, designed in 3D manner.

### Top event in UTM

My proudest logo design would be for Festival Konvokesyen Ke-58 UTM aka Fesko58. The festival were organized by students  to celebrate graduation day, in addition to shaping the entrepreneurial nature and self-confidence among students.

The idea of this logo is to have confetti and graduation hat throw up in the sky. The color of the logo is representing Johor's state color which are red and blue, I admit this is good color combination.

### First freelance's client

Flotilla Ent. offer an exquisite experience cruising around Puteri Harbour, Johor at affordable price. In addition, they are also offering boat rentals for special gathering or events such as the anniversary, grand dinner, honeymoon, or family day.

The logo design is inspired from the anchor shape, fill half of it with blue color to represent 'F' letter of Flotilla.
