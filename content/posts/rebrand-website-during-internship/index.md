Assalamualaikum!

After finished task in [logo design](/posts/best-work-in-logo-illustration#during-internship), I was given responsibility to rebrand RN Technologies website as I join internship as web developer. It has been a great work and I've learned a lot back then because it one-man show project as I'm the only intern there. Eventhough this is fast-paced work in fast-changed technology trend, businesses must keep adapt to stay relevant.

The process start with discussion with my supervisor on what and how the website should be. As I compare with previous design, I keep try and error modifying the website's code to reflect new brand identity. So I proposed that we should use Bootstrap as structure base and proceeded using PHP to create a dynamic content. In addition we also use MySQL to access database for the event management system.

The event managementâ€™s dashboard is using [AdminLTE dashboard template](https://adminlte.io/), the best open source admin dashboard & control panel theme. Built on top of Bootstrap, AdminLTE provides a range of responsive, reusable, and commonly used components.
The modules consists of:

| Module | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Login | Allow user to login and restrict unwanted access |
| Dashboard (calendar view) | List out all event based on each date |
| Profile | Allow user to update their credentials |
| Users management | Allow user to add, edit and remove other users |
| Event management | Allow user to add, edit remove, view (past & inactive) event |

In additions, by using PHP SESSION variable, using middle-ware concept to authenticate user, if the user is not login then system will redirect to login page.
