I'm Amirul, a full-stack Laravel developer passionate in helping business growth. With {{< years-experience >}} of web development experiences across multiple industries - e-commerce, human resources, point of sales - I'm curious and still love to learn new things on how tech work behind the scene.

Currently I'm working on full-time basis, and will share knowledge and updates about my career progress in articles and journal.

The value of **simplicity**, **integrity** and **empathy** are the ideals approach to problem solving in general.
