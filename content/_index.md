I'm Amirul, a passionate web application developer in helping business growth, with {{< years-experience >}} plus of web development experience across multiple industries - e-commerce, human resources, point of sales - I'm still curious and love to learn new things about how tech work behind the scene.

Currently, work on a full-time basis, it's a pleasure to share knowledge and updates about my career progress in articles and journals.

I believe that **simplicity**, **integrity** and **empathy** are the ideal approach to problem-solving in general.
