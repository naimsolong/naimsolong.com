# My current setup

My personal preference of software and hardware that I use to build software.

  <hr/>

## Workstation

I'm currently using laptop that my company provide and this time, I got my chances to have Macbook M3 Pro! (in which expensive for me ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸)

- Apple M3 chip
- 16GB memory
- 500GB SSD
- Sonoma macOS

I've been a Windows user in my entire life and with this, it will be a great opportunity to compare both Windows and Mac in term of developer experience.

## Code Editor

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my main IDE for web development. It's free, open-source, and cross-platform, working on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and it has an in-built debugger. Plus, it has extension marketplace where it support hundreds of programming language and provide a robust tools. A simple extension named [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag) help automatically add close tag and it increase my productivity

Currently, I'm test out on promising code editor, [Zed](https://zed.dev/), a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter. It's also open source.

## Terminal

Just migrated to [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) from [Tabby](https://tabby.sh/) as my ultimate toolbox for remote computing and I used it in my daily task.
Eventhough it might not the same with the one that I used before ([MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)), as this is my first time using Macbook and I want to get familiarize with current setup first.

## Development

For now, I'm gonna use [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) as it has similarity with [Laragon](https://laragon.org/index.html) (for Windows only), the all-in-one development that provides everything that I need to get started with Laravel development including PHP, nginx and Node. Unfortunately, database service like MySQL only available in [Herd Pro](https://herd.laravel.com/#plans). So for this case, I'm gonna use [DBngin](https://dbngin.com/).

In addition, I have love-hate relationship with [Docker](https://docker.com). It does allow for easy deployment and development across multiple platforms, but it consume a lot of resources of the laptop. So I'm might switching to [Podman](https://podman.io/), a fast and lighweight tools to manage containers, pods, and images.

As for git GUI, I'm much preferred using [Fork](https://git-fork.com/), it has been my favourite simple and modern tools since the first day using git. It is also free to use.

## API client

Still trying to figure out on how [bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) works, I like the way we can collaborate API collections through git plus it's offline-only tools.

## Debugging tools

The best value tools I ever bought are [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app/) and [Ray by Spatie](https://myray.app/), it does pricey ðŸ’¸ if you convert to MYR. Tinkerwell allow you to run prototype functions and controller methods without leaving the editor while it integrated with Laravel Herd very well. Meanwhile, Ray is a desktop application that serves as the dedicated home for debugging output.

## Note Taking

I use [Notion](https://notion.so) as my note taking. It support rich media with various file types, it offers syncing cross-platform devices and the best part is it provide customizable templates.
