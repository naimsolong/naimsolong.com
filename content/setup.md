  # My current setup

  My personal preference of software and hardware that I use to build software.

  <hr/>

  ## Workstation

  I'm currently using whatever laptop that my company provide, which is HP Laptop 14-inch with following specs:

  - Intel Core i7-1355U
  - 16GB SDRAM
  - 500GB SSD
  - Windows 11 Home
  
  I've been a Windows for over a decade and it has been a great experience, but I'm planning to switch to Macbook Pro in the future.

  ## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

  I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as my main IDE for web development. It's free, open-source, and cross-platform, working on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and it has an in-built debugger. Plus, it has extension marketplace where it support hundreds of programming language and provide a robust tools. A simple extension named [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag) help automatically add close tag and it increase my productivity

  ## Terminal

  I use [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) as my ultimate toolbox for remote computing and I used it in my daily task.
  It has a lot of features such as tabbed terminal, session management, multi-execution and much more.
  Eventhough, it's free version only limited 12 sessions and 2 SSH Tunnels, this will be enough for me as I only use it for my local.
  
  ## Development

  I have love-hate relationship with [Docker](https://docker.com). It does allow for easy deployment and development across multiple platforms, but it consume a lot of resources in my laptop.

  ## Note Taking

  I use [Notion](https://notion.so) as my note taking. It support rich media with various file types, it offers syncing cross-platform devices and the best part is it provide customizable templates.
